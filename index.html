    <h1>Hi, I'm <i>Luan Paiva</i> </h1>
    <span> <b>About Me</b></span>
    <p> I'm a Computer Science student at Dorset College Dublin, passionate about designing clean and engaging user experiences. I love building interfaces that are not just beautiful but also functional and accessible.</p>

    <h2>Aspiring <b>Frontend Developer </b>|<b> UI/UX Enthusiast</b></h2>
    <p>I'm currently diving into frontend development, creating interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma. In the future, I want to explore mobile development with Flutter and SwiftUI, while also learning more about backend to become a well-rounded Full Stack Developer.</p>
